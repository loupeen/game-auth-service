# Alliance Role-Based Authorization System

**Issue #18: Alliance Role-Based Authorization System**  
**Epic #2: Authentication & Authorization**  
**Status**: âœ… Complete  

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive hierarchical alliance role system implemented for the Loupeen RTS game platform. The system provides fine-grained access control for alliance operations with role inheritance, temporal constraints, quorum requirements, and separation of duties controls.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Role Hierarchy Schema** (`alliance-role-policies-schema.ts`)
   - 8-level hierarchical role system from Recruits to Leader
   - Permission categories and role mappings
   - Transition rules and constraints
   - Quorum requirements for critical decisions

2. **Cedar Policy Engine** (`alliance-role-cedar-policies.ts`)
   - 25+ Cedar policies for alliance operations
   - Role-based permissions with inheritance
   - Temporal and context-aware restrictions
   - Emergency controls and dual approval requirements

3. **Inheritance Manager** (`alliance-role-inheritance.ts`)
   - Role permission inheritance logic
   - Promotion/demotion validation
   - Quorum decision validation  
   - Temporal restriction enforcement

4. **Audit Trail System** (`alliance-role-audit-trail.ts`)
   - Comprehensive audit logging for all role changes
   - Suspicious pattern detection
   - Risk-based event classification
   - Real-time monitoring and alerting

## Alliance Role Hierarchy

### 8-Level Hierarchical Structure

| Role Level | Role Name | Authority Level | Primary Responsibilities |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| 8 | **Leader** | Supreme | Full alliance control, leadership transfer, disbanding |
| 7 | **Vice Leader** | High | Most leader privileges except leadership transfer |  
| 6 | **Officers** | Senior | Tactical operations, senior member management |
| 5 | **Management L1** | Management | Resource & recruitment management |
| 4 | **Management L2** | Management | Basic member management |
| 3 | **Management L3** | Management | Limited operational permissions |
| 2 | **Members** | Standard | Basic alliance participation |
| 1 | **Recruits** | Restricted | New member probation period |

### Role Inheritance Principles

- **Hierarchical Inheritance**: Higher roles inherit all permissions from lower roles
- **Authority Levels**: Role level determines promotion/demotion capabilities
- **Permission Categories**: Organized into logical groups for clear authorization
- **Context Sensitivity**: Permissions adapt based on alliance state and combat status

## Permission Categories

### 1. Member Management Permissions

**Authority Required**: Officer+ for most operations

| Permission | Description | Required Role |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| `member.invite` | Invite new alliance members | Management L1+ |
| `member.kick` | Remove members from alliance | Officer+ (hierarchy rules apply) |
| `member.promote` | Promote members to higher roles | Officer+ (cannot exceed own level) |
| `member.demote` | Demote members to lower roles | Officer+ (dual approval for officers) |
| `member.view-details` | Access member detailed information | Management L2+ |
| `member.manage-notes` | Add/edit member notes | Officer+ |

### 2. Resource Management Permissions

**Authority Required**: Varies by operation

| Permission | Description | Required Role |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| `resource.view` | View alliance resource status | All Members |
| `resource.distribute` | Distribute resources to members | Management L1+ |
| `resource.manage-requests` | Handle resource requests | Management L1+ |
| `resource.treasury` | Access alliance treasury | Officer+ |
| `resource.approve-donations` | Approve large resource donations | Management L1+ |

### 3. Alliance Operations Permissions

**Authority Required**: Vice Leader+ for critical operations

| Permission | Description | Required Role |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| `operation.declare-war` | Declare war on other alliances | Vice Leader+ (quorum required) |
| `operation.accept-peace` | Accept peace offers | Vice Leader+ (quorum required) |
| `operation.form-alliances` | Form diplomatic alliances | Leader only |
| `operation.change-settings` | Modify alliance configuration | Officer+ |
| `operation.manage-description` | Update alliance description | Officer+ |

### 4. Communication Permissions

**Authority Required**: Management L3+ for moderation

| Permission | Description | Required Role |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| `communication.moderate-chat` | Moderate alliance chat | Management L3+ |
| `communication.send-announcements` | Send alliance-wide announcements | Management L1+ |
| `communication.manage-mail` | Manage alliance mail system | Officer+ |
| `communication.represent` | Represent alliance externally | Officer+ |

### 5. Military Permissions

| `military.remote-control` | Remote control member bases | Vice Leader+ (consent required) |

## Role Transition System

### Promotion Rules

1. **Authority Requirements**
   - Promoter must have higher authority than target's new role
   - Leaders can promote anyone to any role (except leader)
   - Cannot promote above your own authority level

2. **Minimum Role Duration** (prevents rapid role cycling)
   - Recruits: 24 hours minimum
   - Members: 72 hours minimum  
   - Management L3: 5 days minimum
   - Management L2: 1 week minimum
   - Management L1: 10 days minimum
   - Officers: 2 weeks minimum
   - Vice Leaders: 3 weeks minimum

3. **Cooldown Periods** (prevents abuse)
   - Promotion cooldown: 24 hours between promotions
   - Demotion cooldown: 48 hours between demotions
   - Leadership transfer: 1 week cooldown

4. **Daily Limits** (prevents mass promotions)
   - Leader: 3 promotions/day
   - Vice Leader: 5 promotions/day
   - Officer: 10 promotions/day
   - Management L1: 15 promotions/day

### Demotion Rules

1. **Authority Requirements**
   - Demoter must have higher authority than target's current role
   - Cannot demote to role equal or higher than your own
   - Special protection for officers and vice leaders (dual approval)

2. **Protected Roles**
   - Officers and Vice Leaders require dual approval for demotion
   - Must have approval from Leader + one other Officer+
   - 48-hour review period for protected role demotions

## Quorum Decision System

### Critical Decisions Requiring Quorum

| Decision | Min Voters | Required Roles | Voting Period | Approval Threshold |
|----------|------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **War Declaration** | 2 | Leader, Vice Leader, Officers | 24 hours | 60% |
| **Peace Acceptance** | 2 | Leader, Vice Leader | 12 hours | 50% |
| **Leadership Transfer** | 3 | Vice Leader, Officers | 72 hours | 66% |
| **Alliance Disbanding** | 5 | Leader, Vice Leader, Officers | 168 hours | 100% |

### Quorum Validation Process

1. **Vote Initiation**
   - Eligible role initiates quorum vote
   - Vote details broadcast to required participants
   - Voting period countdown begins

2. **Vote Collection**
   - Only specified roles can participate
   - Options: Approve, Deny, Abstain
   - Vote changes allowed until deadline

3. **Decision Execution**
   - Automatic validation at voting deadline
   - Must meet minimum voter and approval thresholds
   - Failed votes cannot be re-initiated for 24 hours

## Temporal Constraints and Emergency Controls

### Combat Lockdown

**Active Combat Restrictions**:
- Leadership transfers forbidden
- Alliance disbanding forbidden
- Mass member operations forbidden
- Enhanced approval required for critical resources

**Emergency Powers** (Leader only during combat):
- `military.emergency-command` - Direct military coordination
- `resource.emergency-requisition` - Access emergency resources
- Override normal approval processes with justification

### Time-Based Restrictions

1. **Peak Hours Enhanced Approval** (18:00-23:00 UTC)
   - War declarations require enhanced approval
   - Leadership transfers require additional validation
   - Increased audit logging

2. **Maintenance Windows**
   - Scheduled maintenance lockout periods
   - Non-critical operations suspended
   - Emergency operations only

## Separation of Duties

### Dual Control Requirements

**Actions Requiring Two Approvals**:
- `resource.treasury.withdraw-large` - Large treasury withdrawals
- `member.kick.officer-or-above` - Removing officers or higher
- `operation.disband-alliance` - Alliance disbanding
- `leadership.emergency-override` - Emergency overrides

### Implementation

1. **First Approval**: Initial request by authorized role
2. **Second Approval**: Must come from different person with equal/higher authority
3. **Time Window**: 24-hour window for second approval
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of both approvals

## Audit Trail and Monitoring

### Comprehensive Event Logging

**Audit Event Types**:
- `ROLE_ASSIGNED` - New role assignments
- `ROLE_PROMOTED` - Member promotions
- `ROLE_DEMOTED` - Member demotions  
- `PERMISSION_USED` - Permission usage
- `PERMISSION_DENIED` - Failed permission attempts
- `QUORUM_INITIATED` - Quorum vote started
- `QUORUM_VOTED` - Individual votes cast
- `QUORUM_EXECUTED` - Quorum decision executed
- `LEADERSHIP_TRANSFERRED` - Leadership changes
- `EMERGENCY_OVERRIDE` - Emergency overrides used
- `AUDIT_LOG_ACCESSED` - Audit log viewing

### Risk Level Classification

| Risk Level | Description | Examples |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| **CRITICAL** | Leadership changes, emergency overrides | Leadership transfer, emergency override |
| **HIGH** | Senior role changes, military operations | Officer promotion, war declaration |
| **MEDIUM** | Member management, resource operations | Member kick, resource distribution |
| **LOW** | Routine operations, viewing permissions | View alliance info, chat moderation |

### Suspicious Pattern Detection

**Automated Detection**:
- Rapid role changes (>3 changes per player in 24h)
- Excessive permission failures (>10 failures per player)
- Multiple emergency overrides in short timeframe
- Unusual voting patterns in quorum decisions

**Alert Thresholds**:
- **LOW**: Log warning, continue monitoring
- **MEDIUM**: Notify alliance leadership
- **HIGH**: Immediate notification, enhanced monitoring
- **CRITICAL**: Real-time alerts, temporary restrictions

## API Usage Examples

### Role Promotion Example

```typescript
import AllianceRoleInheritanceManager from './alliance-role-inheritance';

const roleManager = new AllianceRoleInheritanceManager();

// Check if promotion is allowed
const promotionCheck = roleManager.canPromote(
  leaderPlayer,        // Promoter
  memberPlayer,        // Target
  'officer',           // New role
  allianceContext     // Current alliance state
);

if (promotionCheck.allowed) {
  // Execute promotion
  await executePromotion(leaderPlayer, memberPlayer, 'officer');
  
  // Log audit event
  await auditManager.logRoleAssignment(
    allianceId,
    leaderPlayer,
    memberPlayer, 
    'officer',
    'member',
    'Excellent performance in recent battles'
  );
} else {
  console.log(`Promotion denied: ${promotionCheck.reason}`);
}
```

### Permission Check Example

```typescript
// Check if player has specific permission
const hasPermission = roleManager.hasPermission(
  player.role,
  'member.kick'
);

if (hasPermission) {
  // Additional context validation
  const contextCheck = roleManager.checkTemporalRestrictions(
    'member.kick',
    allianceContext
  );
  
  if (contextCheck.allowed) {
    await executeMemberKick(player, targetMember);
  } else {
    console.log(`Action restricted: ${contextCheck.reason}`);
  }
}
```

### Quorum Vote Example

```typescript
// Initiate war declaration vote
const vote: QuorumVote = {
  voteId: generateVoteId(),
  allianceId,
  action: 'DECLARE_WAR',
  initiatedBy: player.playerId,
  initiatedAt: Date.now(),
  votingEndsAt: Date.now() + (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000), // 24 hours
  requiredVoters: 2,
  requiredRoles: ['leader', 'vice-leader', 'officer'],
  approvalThreshold: 0.6,
  votes: [],
  status: 'active'
};

// Store vote and notify eligible voters
await storeQuorumVote(vote);
await notifyEligibleVoters(vote);

// Log audit event
await auditManager.logQuorumEvent(
  allianceId,
  vote,
  player,
  AuditEventType.QUORUM_INITIATED
);
```

## Cedar Policy Examples

### Leader Full Access Policy

```cedar
permit (
  principal,
  action in [
    Action::"inviteMember",
    Action::"kickMember", 
    Action::"promoteMember",
    Action::"demoteMember",
    Action::"viewMemberDetails",
    Action::"manageMemberNotes"
  ],
  resource in Alliance
) when {
  principal has allianceId &&
  principal has role &&
  resource has id &&
  principal.allianceId == resource.id &&
  principal.role == "leader"
};
```

### Officer Hierarchical Kick Policy

```cedar
permit (
  principal,
  action == Action::"kickMember",
  resource in Player
) when {
  principal has allianceId &&
  principal has role &&
  resource has allianceId &&
  resource has role &&
  principal.allianceId == resource.allianceId &&
  principal.role == "officer" &&
  resource.role in ["member", "recruit", "management-l3", "management-l2", "management-l1"]
};
```

### Combat Lockdown Policy

```cedar
forbid (
  principal,
  action in [
    Action::"transferLeadership",
    Action::"disbandAlliance", 
    Action::"massKickMembers"
  ],
  resource
) when {
  resource has allianceId &&
  resource has isInActiveCombat &&
  resource.isInActiveCombat == true
};
```

### Dual Control Treasury Policy

```cedar
forbid (
  principal,
  action == Action::"withdrawLargeTreasury",
  resource
) unless {
  resource has approvedBy &&
  resource has approvalCount &&
  resource.approvalCount >= 2 &&
  resource has approverRoles &&
  (resource.approverRoles contains "leader" ||
   resource.approverRoles contains "vice-leader")
};
```

# Performance testing
npm run test:performance -- alliance
```

## Deployment and Infrastructure

### Database Schema

**Alliance Audit Table** (`alliance-role-audit`):
- Primary Key: `allianceId`, `timestamp`
- GSI: `actorId-timestamp-index` for player activity queries
- GSI: `eventType-timestamp-index` for event type filtering
- GSI: `riskLevel-timestamp-index` for risk-based queries

**DynamoDB Configuration**:
- Billing Mode: PAY_PER_REQUEST for production
- Point-in-time recovery enabled
- Encryption at rest enabled
- TTL on audit events: 2 years retention

### Monitoring and Alerting

**CloudWatch Metrics**:
- `AuditEvents` - Count by alliance, event type, risk level
- `AuditEventErrors` - Failed audit operations
- `PermissionDenials` - Permission denial rate
- `QuorumVotingActivity` - Quorum decision activity

**Alarms**:
- Critical audit events > 5 per hour (CRITICAL)
- Permission denial rate > 10% (WARNING)
- Failed audit operations > 1% (WARNING)
- Emergency overrides > 2 per day per alliance (CRITICAL)

## Security Considerations

### Role Security

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Default deny with explicit permits
2. **Hierarchical Control**: Cannot exceed your own authority level
3. **Temporal Protections**: Combat and time-based restrictions
4. **Audit Trail**: Complete activity logging with pattern detection

### Data Protection

1. **Encryption**: All audit data encrypted at rest and in transit
2. **Access Control**: Audit logs require admin access to view
3. **Data Retention**: 2-year retention with automatic archival
4. **Privacy**: Sensitive data (emergency codes) automatically redacted

### Threat Mitigation

1. **Privilege Escalation**: Hierarchical controls prevent unauthorized elevation
2. **Role Abuse**: Cooldowns and limits prevent rapid changes
3. **Insider Threats**: Dual control and audit trails detect suspicious activity
4. **Account Compromise**: Emergency override restrictions and monitoring

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Advanced Pattern Detection**: Machine learning for anomaly detection
2. **Role Templates**: Predefined role configurations for different alliance types
3. **Dynamic Permissions**: Context-aware permission adjustment
4. **Cross-Alliance Roles**: Diplomatic roles spanning multiple alliances
5. **Mobile Integration**: Push notifications for critical role events

### Performance Targets

- Target: Support 1000+ concurrent alliance operations
- Target: <50ms end-to-end for complex authorization decisions  
- Target: Real-time audit event processing for 10,000+ events/second
- Target: 99.9% uptime for role management services
